# Overengineering
- While I was putting together my own website, lots of thoughts came up such as Cloud provider, Lambdas, EC2, EKS.
- picking the cloud provider was easy as I do already have experience with AWS
- Deciding the deployment structure was tricky because you hear all great things Lambdas can provide you
  but it is not very clear how to limit it uses, so if a bot happens to catch your website, Lambdas end up costing more than expected
- Sometimes less is more, so I went with a simple EC2 small instance that will more more than capable of handling my load
- If someday I realize that more is needed, then I'll take actions accordingly.
